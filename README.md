# DSTI Kagglers

## Target

DSTI Kagglers is a project proposal for the students of the Autumn 2017 cohort of DSTI, created
with the explicit intention to be continued and evolved by the next DSTI cohorts and alumni.

## Motivation

The goals of the project are:

1. educational: to complement the knowledge gained in class with a hands-on data science
    experience that will benefit from the very rich learning resources of the [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) platform
    and from the collaborative nature of the project;
2. portfolio: each member will publish her/his activity on Kaggle and/or Github, gaining
    exposure for potential employers.

## Context

Kaggle, like its company slogan states, is “your home for data science”. It is not the only one
data science competition organizer, but it’s the most popular, you can see for example: [KDD
Cup](http://www.kdd.org/kdd-cup), [Analytics Vidhya Hackathons](https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com/contest/all/), [Hacker Earth Machine Learning Challenges](https://www.hackerearth.com/challenges/), [Data Science
Game](http://datasciencegame.com) (a French organization for students), [Driven Data Competitions](https://www.drivendata.org/), [Crowd Analytix
Community Competitions](https://www.crowdanalytix.com/community), [Tuned IT Challenges](http://tunedit.org/challenges), etc.

There are Kaggle competitions for all levels of experience, from the “Getting Started” category
to “Playground”, “Recruitment”, “Research” and “Featured”, with awards from kudos to jobs
(the “Recruitment” category), or money from $100 to $1,500,000 (the “Featured” category).

An interesting category for DSTI is “InClass”, a category targeting schools like DSTI that want to
host a student competition to apply machine learning to real problems! This could give more
exposure to DSTI – it’s something DSTI can consider, starting with the next cohorts.

However, the main goal of the project is education, not competition. The DSTI Kagglers project
is a public trace of the data science learning experience of its members, more like a community
rather than a competition team.

As all projects, it has a start (now) and an end (when the classes for its originating cohort will
finish) but this timeframe must be linked only to the Autumn 2017 cohort as the next cohorts
will “restart” the project on the basis the originating members will have been delivered at that
moment. So it’s a project created to continue and evolve in time.


Google is encouraging such initiatives as you can read in this [post](http://blog.kaggle.com/2017/08/09/learn-data-science-from-kaggle-competition-meetups/) on the Kaggle blog, post that
is full of suggestions on how to organize a local Kaggle community. An interesting note at the
end of the post states that “if you're launching a new Meetup, we'd also love to help reach out
to other Kagglers in your area. Get a hold of us at [markmc@google.com](mailto:markmc@google.com)”. This invitation,
together with the “InClass” competition category (see above) created specifically for schools
like DSTI, will give more exposure to the project and school and implicitly to its members and
students.

## Challenges

All beginnings are hard, this project is no exception.

The DSTI students have chosen to prepare for a career in data science and they are gaining
knowledge in parallel with the project. The knowledge gained in class and the knowledge
required to solve a Kaggle problem are almost never in sync. That leads to the conclusion that
the difficulty of the problems must be chosen carefully, in accordance with the level of the
project members, in order to obtain a smoother learning pah.

Some project members are not totally new to data science and so they will proactively help the
others to progress.

Another challenge is the time available, both for the project (5 months) and project members.
This requires a sustainable, efficient regularity of the project meetings/presentations and an
effort commitment at individual level.

## Deliverables

All project members will meet with regularity every 3 weeks via Skype and one of them, by
rotation, will present a problem solution, proposed and agreed at the previous meeting. During
the time between meetings, all project members will work individually or in adhoc teams on the
same problem, in order to have a better, constructive participation at the presentation and to
assure a continuous hands-on preparation.

After every such meeting, the presenter will upload on Github (a dedicated organization
account) the presentation and the related code and write a post on Github reflecting the
discussions during the presentation.

By April 8th 2018 the project will contain 7 presentations and at least 7 posts on Github.

The first problem will be the classical “[Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic)” competition.

After the first 3 “Getting started” problems, the members will chose a little harder problems on
which they will work as an unique Kaggle team (the “Dog Breed Identification” problem you can


see below in the roadmap is an active problem). The “[Cryptocurrency Historical Prices](https://www.kaggle.com/sudalairajkumar/cryptocurrencypricehistory)” could be
another exciting problem for later meetups, as it is harder ([Jérémie](https://github.com/jeremm)’s proposal).

## Roadmap

1. November 20 th 2017 : “[Titanic](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic)” meetup ([Adrian](http://github.com/adrianflorea) will present)
2. December 11 th 2017 : “[House prices](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques)” meetup (to be decided until Nov 20th)
3. January 8th 2018: TBD: “[Digit Recognizer](https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer)” meetup (to be decided until Dec 11th)
4. January 29th 2018: TBD: “[Dog Breed Identification](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dog-breed-identification)” meetup (winners will receive kudos :)
    - to be decided until Jan 29th)
5. February 19th 2018: TBD (to chose from the “[Playground](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions?sortBy=prize&group=all&page=1&pageSize=20&segment=playground)” category)
6. March 12th 201 8: TBD (to chose from the “[Playground](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions?sortBy=prize&group=all&page=1&pageSize=20&segment=playground)” category)
7. April 2nd 2018: TBD (to chose from the “[Playground](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions?sortBy=prize&group=all&page=1&pageSize=20&segment=playground)” category)

We have one buffer week (the week between April 2nd 2018 and April 8th 2018).

## Organisation

There is no need for a “project manager”, someone between the project members will
volunteer to deal with minor administrative stuff in addition to the regular activity – the team is
self-organized.

The more experienced project members will proactively help the less experienced peers.

If other students of the Autumn 2017 cohort will want to join later, they can do it unless such
move risks to perturb the other projects. At the moment the project has 7 members.

The communication will be done via the [DSTI-Kagglers](https://dsti-kagglers.slack.com/) Slack workspace already created (the
invitations to join the Slack workspace are sent).
