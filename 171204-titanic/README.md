The first technical meetup was on 4th of December, 2017, on the Titanic challenge.
The following people have presented their solutions:

* [Jérémie Merigeault](https://github.com/JeremM) (Python, using scikit-learn)
* [Adrian Florea](https://github.com/adrianflorea) (Python, using scikit-learn with pipelines)
* [Graeme Smith](https://github.com/the-tourist-) (R, using caret)
* [Kondamadugula Vishnuvardhanreddy](https://github.com/vishnu772) (R, not enough time to present his solution but he posted it on Github)
* [Jean-Marc Uzé](https://github.com/jmarc-u) and [Riccardo Corvetti](https://github.com/RiccardoCorvetti) (active participation, lots of questions, not enough time to present their solutions)
* [Pajtim Emerllahu](https://github.com/Prodigy-PJ) and Gisèle Brown (attended the meeting)

The meetup was pretty long (several good hours, possibly more than 3), very interactive, lot of interest shown through the questions asked and in the preparation of their own solutions before the meetup.
